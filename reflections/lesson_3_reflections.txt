When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you want to collaborate with other users or be able to download your own
work from cloud storage.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	So that way your local changes don't get overwritten in the case that you're ahead of your remote repository.
