What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	It creates the .git file that Git repositories require.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area allows the programmer to decide what should be commited to the repository from the working
directory. It allows the programmer to not have to commit everything in the working directory to the repository
everytime that the programmer wants to commit something(s).



How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	The programmer can use the staging area to choose exactly which files to submit to be committed.



What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

	When you want to create break-offs in the development of your program, say to create a Spanish version of
your software or build an easier game mode. Creating these break-offs would allow you to develop your main program
as well as the break-offs individually.
