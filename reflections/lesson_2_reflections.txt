What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	It creates the .git file that Git repositories require.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area allows the programmer to decide what should be commited to the repository from the working
directory. It allows the programmer to not have to commit everything in the working directory to the repository
everytime that the programmer wants to commit something(s).
